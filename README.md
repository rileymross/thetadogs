# Theta Dogs
A simple solidity script that returns curtains names based on their identifying numbers I that I injected into the contract, and vice versa. In this case, the names were in references to dogs I used to take care of, and random numbers I chose to assign to them. For example, put in "Gizmo" and nameToFavoriteNumber will return the number "5". Here is the deployed contract on the Theta Testnet: https://testnet-explorer.thetatoken.org/account/0x13f49d5f774e9b06d44ed6d67ca283e04da3e5f8
