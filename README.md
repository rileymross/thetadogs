# Theta Dogs
A simple solidity script that returns curtains names based on their identifying numbers I that I injected into the contract, and vice versa. In this case, the names were in references to dogs I used to take care of, and random numbers I chose to assign to them.
For example, put in "Gizmo" and nameToFavoriteNumber will return the number "5".
Then there are the index numbers in the second column that can be entered (that begin from 0 and onward) to learn the names of each dog. For example, index number 0 is Russ, and his favorite number is 7!
